                    <h1>Smash Character Picker Old Versions</h1>
                    <p>These are all the old versions of the Smash Bros. Character Picker, from 1.0 through 8.0. These are
                        also tagged on
                        <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Smash-Character-Picker/tags">GitHub</a>. For more
                        details, see the README that comes with each version on GitHub.
                        <br><br>
                        Note that many versions feature differently-formatted tier lists from one another. The current tier
                        list format (including the ability to add comments) wasn't adopted until the latest version. As
                        such, each version comes with its own tier list file to use, and they generally cannot be mixed and
                        matched with other versions. A .jar file is also included with each download.

                            but when I decided to abandon this functionality, I simply moved on to the next version.
                            However, this version did feature the first iteration of more or less every feature seen in 
                            v4.0. One could consider this a beta for v4.0, basically.

                            This includes an even smaller window than v2.0, with all the settings being put behind a
                            window accessed through the menu bar. This version includes the same settings as v2.1, but
                            also includes two new settings (which were actually introduced in the unfinished v3.0): the
                            option to set custom tier chances and the introduction of the "Cannot Get" buffer, features
                            which persist to this day. However, in this version, the function of the "Cannot Get" buffer
                            is slightly different.

                        <td>This version features the first edition of the current, menu bar-less UI. All settings are
                            instead simply located to the left of the results field. The settings have also been
                            simplified, removing the settings from v2.1, but keeping the settings added in v4.2. The
                            soundboard has also been implemented for the first time. Finally, a new functionality under
                            the hood, the CannotGetQueue,
                            has been added. This is basically a special data structure that handles the
                            "Cannot Get" buffer in a simpler manner than v4.2 did. Also, this version features the
                            modern version of the "Cannot Get" buffer, where <i>all</i> fighters in a battle are
                            restricted from being chosen again for a set period of time. However, this version does not
                            include the "Individual Cannot Get" system yet. This can be considered the first modern
                            version of the program, with all future versions being built off this one.

                            The skip button is also introduced. Finally, the "Individual Cannot Get" system has been
                            implemented. As such, the current version of the "Cannot Get" system is now in place, with the
                            exception of the favorites feature. See the README on
                            <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Smash-Character-Picker">GitHub</a> for a
                            more detailed explanation on how exactly it works.

                            Otherwise, there are minimal changes in this version. It was enough work that I gave it its
                            own project in Eclipse, that's why it's listed as a separate version here and on GitHub. Most of
                            the time, when I made incremental updates (i.e. v2.0 to v2.1 or v4.0 through v4.2), I didn't
                            create a new project locally, which is why only the latest version of each major iteration is
                            kept. The exception being v6.0 and v6.4.

                            ActionListeners, and it does not feature soundboard optimizations that cut down extensively
                            on code duplication. Both of those features are introduced in v9.0.

                            but when I decided to abandon this functionality, I simply moved on to the next version.
                            However, this version did feature the first iteration of more or less every feature seen in 
                            v4.0. One could consider this a beta for v4.0, basically.

                            window accessed through the menu bar. This version includes the same settings as v2.1, but
                            also includes two new settings (which were actually introduced in the unfinished v3.0): the
                            option to set custom tier chances and the introduction of the "Cannot Get" buffer, features
                            which persist to this day. However, in this version, the function of the "Cannot Get" buffer
                            is slightly different.

                            instead simply located to the left of the results field. The settings have also been
                            simplified, removing the settings from v2.1, but keeping the settings added in v4.2. The
                            soundboard has also been implemented for the first time. Finally, a new functionality under
                            the hood, the CannotGetQueue,
                            has been added. This is basically a special data structure that handles the
                            "Cannot Get" buffer in a simpler manner than v4.2 did. Also, this version features the
                            modern version of the "Cannot Get" buffer, where <i>all</i> fighters in a battle are
                            restricted from being chosen again for a set period of time. However, this version does not
                            include the "Individual Cannot Get" system yet. This can be considered the first modern
                            version of the program, with all future versions being built off this one.

                            Otherwise, there are minimal changes in this version. It was enough work that I gave it its
                            own project in Eclipse, that's why it's listed as a separate version here and on GitHub. Most of
                            the time, when I made incremental updates (i.e. v2.0 to v2.1 or v4.0 through v4.2), I didn't
                            create a new project locally, which is why only the latest version of each major iteration is
                            kept. The exception being v6.0 and v6.4.

                            ActionListeners, and it does not feature soundboard optimizations that cut down extensively
                            on code duplication. Both of those features are introduced in v9.0.
