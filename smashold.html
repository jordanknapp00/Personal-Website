                <h1>Smash Character Picker Old Versions</h1>
                <p>These are all the old versions of the Smash Bros. Character Picker, from 1.0 through 9.0. These are also tagged on <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Smash-Character-Picker/tags">GitHub</a>. For more details, see the README that comes with each version on GitHub.
                <br><br>
                Note that many versions feature differently-formatted tier lists from one another. The current tier list format (including the ability to add comments) wasn't adopted until the latest version. As such, each version comes with its own tier list file to use, and they generally cannot be mixed and matched with other versions. An executable .jar file is also included with each download.</p>

                        <td>A simple, text-based program designed to be run in the IDE. The tiers are defined directly as ArrayLists. There are exclusion lists for each player, but there is no "Cannot Get" buffer and no system to prevent duplicate matchups. In fact, the program halts after a match is generated, so there would be no way to implement those systems in this version of the program anyways. It became clear very quickly that I needed to add a GUI (something I had to teach myself) and make many more changes in order to allow the program to do everything I wanted it to be able to do.

Aside from being able to select the number of players and change which tiers are being used, the program is still about as bare-bones as v1.0.</td>

This version was to feature two different tier generation algorithms, but I decided to abandon this functionality. I simply moved on to the next version after that. However, this version did feature the first iteration of more or less every feature seen in v4.0. One could consider this a beta for v4.0, basically.</td>

This includes an even smaller window than v2.0, with all the settings being put behind a window accessed through the menu bar. This version includes the same settings as v2.1, but also includes two new settings (which were actually introduced in the unfinished v3.0): the option to set custom tier chances and the introduction of the "Cannot Get" buffer, features which persist to this day. However, in this version, the function of the "Cannot Get" buffer is slightly different.

The settings have also been simplified, removing the settings from v2.1, but keeping the settings added in v4.2. The soundboard has also been implemented for the first time. Finally, a new functionality under the hood, the CannotGetQueue, has been added. This is basically a special data structure that handles the "Cannot Get" buffer in a simpler manner than v4.2 did. Also, this version features the modern version of the "Cannot Get" buffer, where <i>all</i> fighters in a battle are restricted from being chosen again for a set period of time. However, this version does not include the "Individual Cannot Get" system yet. This can be considered the first modern version of the program, with all future versions being directly derived from this one.</td>

See the README on <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00/Smash-Character-Picker">GitHub</a> for a more detailed explanation on how exactly it works.</td>

Once again, more details on how it works under the hood can be found in the README on GitHub. Otherwise, there are minimal changes in this version. It was enough work that I gave it its own project in Eclipse, that's why it's listed as a separate version here and on GitHub. Most of the time, when I made incremental updates (i.e. v2.0 to v2.1 or v4.0 through v4.2), I didn't create a new project locally, which is why only the latest version of each major iteration is kept. The exception being v6.0 and v6.4.</td>

A handful of bug fixes and a good amount of code optimization, basically. It features inline functions for <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">ActionListner</span> classes. And the soundboard has essentially been rewritten from scratch to reduce code duplication. It went from around 700 lines to around 300. Other than that, there are few changes in this version.</td>
