                        I've included this project because it was by far one of the most challenging, but also one of the most rewarding projects I've had the experience of working on. It is one of the most fully-featured programs I've worked on as a school project. And I learned a lot from it about both the C language and how Unix works.</td>

Three primary data structures are used. First, the tour itself is simply stored in an ArrayList, though it's in a class which features several utility methods. A slightly modified AA tree is used to map location names to their index within a tour, which makes looking them up more efficient. Finally, the spatial data, the actual <i>coordinates</i> at which locations are located, is stored in a Wrapped K-D Tree.
                        <br><br>
                        The Tour and WKDTree classes were written by me. The AAXTree class was provided by the instructor. Implementation of the AA tree was an early part of the assignment, and mine had some errors. The instructor provided canonical implementations after each stage of the project, so I used that rather than spending  time trying to fix my version.

In the game, the player traverses levels and sets off traps in order to kill enemies. There are three kinds of enemies, each of which behave somewhat differently. There is a fairly robust AI system, in which enemies can move between patrol, pursuit, and search states.
                        <br><br>
                        It should be noted that all art assets came from <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/">Kenney</a>, a website that provides free assets for games. I am not an artist. As mentioned, this was a group project. One of the things I was responsible for was creating animation for those 3D models. This was done with a simple sine wave moving limbs back and forth, resulting in Minecraft-esque animations. I also implemented player movement, camera movement (which includes a system for turning objects between the player and camera transparent), enemy AI, minor parts of the interface, and one of the two levels. All other features, such as creation of the game concept itself, interaction with traps, most of the UI, the player and enemy health systems, etc., were done by my teammate.
                        <br><br>
                        I don't think the game ended up being particularly impressive, but it was definitely a valuable learning experience. We struggled with the concept for the game, so it ended up changing many times throughout the development cycle.

                        <td>By far the most useful project during my time at UMD, this was a group project in which I developed a web app along with four other people. We followed Agile principles while developing the app, including three sprints and roughly twice-weekly scrum meetings (daily scrum meetings weren't really feasible due to the scale of the project and people's busy schedules). The first sprint was one week, while the subsequent sprints were two weeks each, creating a five-week development cycle. This was perhaps the most valuable part of the project to me, learning how software is actually developed in the industry. This class also taught me how to make my code more readable and how to use Git to collaborate, both of which were applied during the development of this project.
                        <br><br>
                        The project itself was Online Casino, a website in which users can deposit and withdraw "money" in order to gamble in five casino games — Poker, Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, and Slot Machines. The first three featured fully-functional multiplayer, while the latter two were single-player only. Multiplayer was implemented using websockets, something I had never used before. They ended up being a huge struggle to wrap my head around. Users can sign up, create accounts, become friends with other users, send links to one another to easily join each other's games, and chat with one another during the games. There is a spectating system so people can watch the games unfold without participating. Other features include tutorials for each game and a system to limit the amount of money that can be deposited onto an account with the site each month.
                        <br><br>
                        As this was a group project, obviously I was not responsible for everything. One member of our group had already used Django before, so we tended to follow his lead for just about everything. I was responsible for implementing the depositing and withdrawing money systems, the tutorials, the chat system, and the game of Craps.
                        <br><br>
                        As mentioned, I think this was the most valuable project I worked on during my time at UMD. This class and project gave me more exposure to real software engineering practices than every other class combined.</td>
