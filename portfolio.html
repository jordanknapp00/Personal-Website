                <hr>
                <p>Major projects are all fully-featured programs, larger in scope than minor projects. These all took a significant amount of time to develop.</p>

Matches with up to 8 players are supported. There are systems to prevent duplicate matchups, in order to keep things fresh. There is also a built-in soundboard and a statistics tracking system. There are a variety of other settings to customize the experience. More details can be found in the README on GitHub.

                        This was my first time designing a program that is not text-based, and as a result, I had to teach myself how to use the Java Swing library. The result is one of the largest and most complex projects I've worked on, school project or not.

The algorithm is based on one provided by my game development professor, which itself was based on the algorithm used in Rogue. I've modified the algorithm a little bit and added the ability to customize the dungeon via command line parameters. I've also added some object-oriented features to the program. I wrote this project attempting to use good software engineering practices (particularly the use of develop and feature branches with Git), in order to build that up as a habit. I also wrote it as a test of my C# skills outside the context of Unity development.

                <hr>
                <p>Minor projects are small programs, not as fully-featured or wide in scope as major projects. These are mostly text-based programs that quickly solve a problem, test something, or otherwise do something simpler than major projects. These are only available via .zip download. I didn't think they were important enough to warrant putting them on GitHub.</p>

It was meant to power a simple role-playing game. Ultimately, I abandoned this project because I was unhappy with the quality of the tutorial. I instead decided to take a game programming class in my last semester at UMD.
                        <br><br>
                        The engine is only capable of displaying a single map, with a single character walking around that map. The collision detection is also somewhat buggy. If this project were completed, or even in a state that might be called playable, I'd probably put it in the major projects category, because it was a lot of work to even get it this far.</td>

                <p>During my time at UMD, I worked on over 50 projects, going from basic programming skills all the way up to a software engineering group project that attempted to closely match how it's actually done in the industry. I described some of the most interesting, challenging, and useful school projects <a href="schoolprojects.html">on this page</a>.</p>
