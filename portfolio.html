                    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
                        <p>These are some of the various projects I've worked on in my spare time over the years. The
                            tables below contain information about each project, as well as download links. Links to
                            <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00">my GitHub</a> are available for the major projects,
                            while .zip downloads are available for all projects. Direct downloads for Java projects will
                            include an executable .jar file.
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that the projects on GitHub do not follow any kind of branching scheme. I didn't use GitHub
                            when developing these projects, and I didn't know about proper GitHub use when initially uploading
                            the projects to GitHub. I'm currently taking a software engineering course, and I now know how to
                            use a develop branch, release branches, feature branches, etc. But I was not able to employ that
                            knowledge when creating the repositories for these personal projects.

                    <p>These are the major projects, the ones that took a significant amount of time. They could all be
                        described as fully-featured programs, meaning they aren't just quick solutions to a problem.</p>

                            based on one written by my game development professor, which itself was based on the algorithm
                            used in Rogue. I've modified the algorithm a little bit and added the ability to customize the
                            dungeon via command line parameters. I've also added some object-oriented features to the program.
                            I wrote this project attempting to use good software engineering practices (particularly the use
                            of develop and feature branches), in order to build that up as a habit. I also wrote it as a test
                            of my C# skills outside the context of Unity development.

                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)">Rogue</a> (1980). The algorithm is
                            based on one written by my game development professor, which itself was based on the algorithm
                            used in Rogue. I've modified the algorithm a little bit and added the ability to customize the
                            dungeon via command line parameters. I've also added some object-oriented features to the program.
                            I wrote this project attempting to use good software engineering practices (particularly the use
                            of develop and feature branches), in order to build that up as a habit. I also wrote it as a test
                            of my C# skills outside the context of Unity development.

                        something, or otherwise do something simpler than the major projects. These are only available for
                        .zip download, because they're not really important enough to warrant putting on GitHub.

                            There are three kinds of enemies, each of which behave somewhat differently. There is a

                            I am not an artist. I was responsible for creating animation for those 3D models, however.
                            This was done with a simple sine wave moving limbs back and forth, resulting in
                            Minecraft-esque animations. I also implemented player movement, camera movement (which
                            includes a system for turning objects between the player and camera transparent), enemy
                            AI, parts of the interface, and one of the two levels. Everything else, including the game
                            concept itself, was done by my teammate.

                            changing many times throughout the development cycle. If we'd known what we wanted to do
                            from the start, the game may have turned out better.

                        <td>By far the most useful project during my time at UMD, this was a group project in which I
                            developed a web app along with four other people. We followed Agile principles while
                            developing the app, including three sprints and roughly twice-weekly scrum meetings (daily
                            scrum meetings weren't really feasible due to the scale of the project and people's busy
                            schedules). The first sprint was one week, while the subsequent sprints were two weeks each,
                            leading to a five-week development cycle. This was perhaps the most valuable part of the
                            project to me, learning how software is actually developed in the industry. This class also
                            taught me how to make my code more readable and how to use Git to collaborate, both of which
                            were applied during the development of this project.
                            <br><br>
                            The project itself was Online Casino, a website in which users can deposit and withdraw "money"
                            in order to gamble in five casino games -- Poker, Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, and Slot
                            Machines. The first three featured fully-functional multiplayer, while the latter two were
                            single-player only. Multiplayer was implemented using websockets, something I had never used
                            before. They ended up being a huge struggle to wrap my head around. Users can sign up, create
                            accounts, become friends with other users, send links to one another to easily join each
                            other's games, and chat with one another during the games. There is a spectating system so
                            people can watch the games unfold without participating. Other minor features include tutorials
                            for each game and a system to limit the amount of money that can be deposited into your
                            account each month.

                            As this was a group project, obviously I was not responsible for everything. One member of our
                            group had already used Django before, so we tended to follow his lead for just about everything.
                            I was responsible for implementing the depositing and withdrawing money systems, the tutorials,
                            the chat system, and the game of Craps.
                            <br><br>
                            As mentioned, I think this was the most valuable project I worked on during my time at UMD.
                            This class and project gave me more exposure to real software engineering practices than every
                            other class combined.

                        <td>By far the most useful project during my time at UMD, this was a group project in which I
                            developed a web app along with four other people. We followed Agile principles while
                            developing the app, including three sprints and roughly twice-weekly scrum meetings (daily
                            scrum meetings weren't really feasible due to the scale of the project and people's busy
                            schedules). The first sprint was one week, while the subsequent sprints were two weeks each,
                            leading to a five-week development cycle. This was perhaps the most valuable part of the
                            project to me, learning how software is actually developed in the industry. This class also
                            taught me how to make my code more readable and how to use Git to collaborate, both of which
                            were applied during the development of this project.
                            <br><br>
                            The project itself was Online Casino, a website in which users can deposit and withdraw "money"
                            in order to gamble in five casino games -- Poker, Blackjack, Craps, Roulette, and Slot
                            Machines. The first three featured fully-functional multiplayer, while the latter two were
                            single-player only. Multiplayer was implemented using websockets, something I had never used
                            before. They ended up being a huge struggle to wrap my head around. Users can sign up, create
                            accounts, become friends with other users, send links to one another to easily join each
                            other's games, and chat with one another during the games. There is a spectating system so
                            people can watch the games unfold without participating. Other minor features include tutorials
                            for each game and a system to limit the amount of money that can be deposited into your
                            account each month.
                            <br><br>
                            As this was a group project, obviously I was not responsible for everything. One member of our
                            group had already used Django before, so we tended to follow his lead for just about everything.
                            I was responsible for implementing the depositing and withdrawing money systems, the tutorials,
                            the chat system, and the game of Craps.

                            As mentioned, I think this was the most valuable project I worked on during my time at UMD.
                            This class and project gave me more exposure to real software engineering practices than every
                            other class combined.
