                    <h1>Personal Projects</h1>
                        <p>These are some of the various projects I've worked on in my spare time over the years. The
                            tables below contain information about each project, as well as download links. Links to
                            <a href="https://github.com/jordanknapp00">my GitHub</a> are available for the major projects,
                            while .zip downloads are available for all projects. Direct downloads for Java projects will
                            include an executable .jar file.
                        </p>
                        <p>Note that the projects on GitHub do not follow any kind of branching scheme. I didn't use GitHub
                            when developing these projects, and I didn't know about proper GitHub use when initially uploading
                            the projects to GitHub. I'm currently taking a software engineering course, and I now know how to
                            use a develop branch, release branches, feature branches, etc. But I was not able to employ that
                            knowledge when creating the repositories for these personal projects.

                    <p>These are the major projects, the ones that took a significant amount of time. They could all be
                        described as fully-featured programs, meaning they aren't just quick solutions to a problem.</p>
